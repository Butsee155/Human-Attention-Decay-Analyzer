🚀 Project Title
Human Attention Decay Analyzer

Modeling how human focus collapses in digital environments

🧠 Project Overview

Human attention is the scarcest resource in the digital age.

This project analyzes how long users stay focused on apps, how attention decays over time, and which categories destroy or preserve focus using real screen-time data.

Unlike traditional engagement analytics, this project models attention decay curves and estimates attention half-life, inspired by problems relevant to X, Neuralink, and human–computer interaction research.

🎯 Objectives

Measure attention decay over time

Estimate attention half-life

Identify high-fragmentation apps

Compare productive vs non-productive attention

Build a professional analytics dashboard for decision-makers

📊 Dataset

Screen Time and App Usage Dataset (iOS / Android)

Key attributes:

user_id

date

app_name

category

screen_time_min

launches

interactions

is_productive

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI

Power Query

Data Modeling & Feature Engineering

🔍 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Normalized screen-time metrics

Engineered features:

Attention intensity

Fragmentation score

Time buckets

2️⃣ Attention Decay Modeling

Calculated user drop-off over time

Modeled attention decay curves

Estimated attention half-life

Compared decay across app categories

3️⃣ Visualization & Dashboarding

Built a dark-themed, executive-style Power BI dashboard with:

KPI cards (attention intensity, half-life, fragmentation)

Attention decay line charts

Category-wise attention comparison

Productive vs non-productive attention analysis

Interactive filters (date, category, productivity)

📈 Key Insights

Attention drops 50% within the first few time buckets for non-productive apps

Productivity apps show longer attention half-life

High launch frequency strongly correlates with attention fragmentation

Entertainment & social apps cause the fastest cognitive decay

🧠 Why This Project Is Different

Most analytics projects measure:

Clicks

Views

Engagement rates

This project measures:

Cognitive endurance

Attention decay

Human focus sustainability

This framing aligns with Neuralink, X, and human-centered AI problems.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Predict attention decay using ML

Personal attention risk score

Real-time data integration

Cognitive load forecasting
